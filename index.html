    <h1>Hardest Thing I Now Understand</h1>
    <p> The hardest thing I understand is the d3 algorithm. I just find it easy to follow along with the formula for why a element is created the way it is. The steps: Select, selectall, data, enter, append and decorate; make sense for how and why elements are made they way they are. By choosing a specific element to begin with then deciding the type of data to be appended to the code, the algorithim is quite simple to follow. </p>
    
    <h2>Hardest Thing I Dont Understand</h2>
    <p> One thing I am still struggling with today is the mapping concept in JavaScript. I understand that it's a way to find data inside an array whther it's all of them or just one piece, however since learning Python, the how the function works just baffles me and I continue to disregard its usefulness. Im used to make my own function using other methods and different inputs and yet the mapping can do all in one. I even at times forget that I can use mapping in certain cituiations because I am not certain if it has the capabiliteis to create the solution to the problem at hand. So Id say my biggest question is, when do I know when to use mapping? Lastly, I need to continue working on making helper funtions to make my work go easier and faster aswell as fix a few syntax errors here and there. </p>
